# repotoforkforteaching

Short dummy repo used for teaching purposes.

Try to fork it, clone it locally on your computer, copy the file present there, modify the content and save as helloWorldNN.py (NN are your initials). 
Then push it upstram, and try to open a PR (Pull Request) with my original repo. If your file will land in my repo you'll get a "sehr gut" :-)
